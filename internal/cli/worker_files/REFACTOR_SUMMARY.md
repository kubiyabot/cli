## ✨ Key Improvements

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- **Activities**: Pure Temporal boilerplate (~50-150 lines each)
- **Services**: Business logic, no Temporal dependency
- **Models**: Data structures only
- **Utils**: Reusable helpers

### 2. Testability
- **Before**: Required Temporal runtime to test
- **After**: Services can be unit tested independently

### 3. Reusability
- SessionService: Used by both agent and team executors
- CancellationManager: Shared global singleton
- ToolsetFactory: Centralized toolset creation
- StreamingHelper: Shared streaming logic

### 4. Maintainability
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service does ONE thing well
- **DRY Principle**: No code duplication
- **Clear Dependencies**: Explicit service injection
- **Easy Navigation**: Find code by responsibility

## 🔧 Service Responsibilities

### AgentExecutorService
- Load session history via SessionService
- Create Agno Agent with LiteLLM configuration
- Instantiate toolsets via ToolsetFactory
- Execute with streaming via StreamingHelper
- Register with CancellationManager
- Persist session via SessionService

### TeamExecutorService
- Load session history via SessionService
- Create Agno Team with member agents
- Instantiate toolsets for each member via ToolsetFactory
- Execute with streaming via StreamingHelper
- Register with CancellationManager
- Persist session via SessionService

### SessionService
- Load session history from Control Plane (with retry)
- Build conversation context for Agno
- Extract messages from Agno results
- Persist session history to Control Plane (with retry)

### CancellationManager
- Register agent/team instances for cancellation
- Capture run_id from streaming
- Cancel execution via Agno's cancel_run API
- Cleanup after completion

### ToolsetFactory
- Create Agno toolsets from Control Plane configuration
- Support: FileTools, ShellTools, PythonTools, DockerTools
- Handle disabled toolsets gracefully

### StreamingHelper
- Handle run_id capture and publishing
- Stream content chunks to Control Plane
- Publish tool execution events (start/complete)
- Collect full response content

## 🎯 Migration Details

### Activities Refactored

**agent_activities.py:**
```python
# Before: 1,107 lines with all logic mixed together
# After: 317 lines

@activity.defn(name="execute_agent_llm")
async def execute_agent_llm(input: AgentExecutionInput) -> dict:
    """Thin wrapper around AgentExecutorService"""
    control_plane = get_control_plane_client()
    session_service = SessionService(control_plane)
    executor = AgentExecutorService(
        control_plane, session_service, cancellation_manager
    )
    return await executor.execute(input)
```

**team_activities.py:**
```python
# Before: 1,186 lines with all logic mixed together
# After: 258 lines

@activity.defn(name="execute_team_coordination")
async def execute_team_coordination(input: ActivityExecuteTeamInput) -> dict:
    """Thin wrapper around TeamExecutorService"""
    control_plane = get_control_plane_client()
    session_service = SessionService(control_plane)
    executor = TeamExecutorService(
        control_plane, session_service, cancellation_manager
    )
    return await executor.execute(input)
```

## ✅ Verification Results

### Syntax Checks: PASSED
- All Python files compile successfully
- No syntax errors

### Import Checks: PASSED
```
✅ AgentExecutorService imported successfully
✅ TeamExecutorService imported successfully
✅ SessionService imported successfully
✅ CancellationManager imported successfully
✅ ToolsetFactory imported successfully
✅ StreamingHelper imported successfully
✅ retry_with_backoff imported successfully
✅ Input models imported successfully
✅ Agent activities imported successfully
✅ Team activities imported successfully
✅ Worker.py imports successful
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. ✅ **Code Refactoring** - COMPLETED
2. ✅ **Basic Import/Syntax Tests** - COMPLETED
3. 🔄 **End-to-End Testing** - PENDING
   - Test agent execution with session persistence
   - Test team execution with session persistence
   - Test cancellation (STOP button)
   - Test session continuity across turns
   - Test retry logic under failure conditions

## 📝 Backward Compatibility

All activities maintain backward compatibility:
- Activity names unchanged
- Input/output signatures unchanged
- Workflow integration seamless
- Type aliases for old names:
  ```python
  ActivityExecuteAgentInput = AgentExecutionInput
  ActivityUpdateExecutionInput = UpdateExecutionStatusInput
  ActivityUpdateAgentInput = UpdateAgentStatusInput
  ```

## 🎉 Benefits Realized

1. **71-78% code reduction** in activity files
2. **Clear separation** of concerns
3. **Easier testing** - services independent of Temporal
4. **Better maintainability** - changes isolated to specific services
5. **Code reusability** - shared services across activities
6. **Professional architecture** - follows clean architecture principles
7. **No breaking changes** - fully backward compatible

## 🔐 Backup Files

Old implementations backed up:
- `activities/agent_activities_old.py.bak`
- `activities/team_activities_old.py.bak`

These can be deleted once end-to-end testing confirms everything works.
