# Runtime Abstraction - Quick Start Guide

## What Was Done

I've successfully implemented a runtime abstraction layer that makes your worker code agnostic to agent frameworks. This allows agents to be powered by different SDKs:

- **Default (Agno)**: Your current Agno-based implementation
- **Claude Code**: New integration with Claude Code SDK
- **Future**: Easy to add LangChain, LlamaIndex, AutoGen, etc.

## Key Files Created

### 1. Architecture & Documentation
- `RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Complete architecture design
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Detailed implementation summary
- `QUICK_START.md` - This file

### 2. Database Changes
- `db/migrations/010_add_runtime_to_agents.sql` - Adds `runtime` field to agents table
- `app/models/agent.py` - Updated with `RuntimeType` enum and `runtime` column

### 3. Runtime Abstraction Layer

├── default_runtime.py        # Agno adapter
└── claude_code_runtime.py    # Claude Code SDK adapter
```

### 4. Refactored Service
- `services/agent_executor_v2.py` - New runtime-agnostic executor

## Quick Demo

### Create Agent with Default Runtime (Agno)

```python
# Existing behavior - no changes needed
agent = {
    "name": "Data Analyst",
    "runtime": "default",  # Optional, this is the default
    "model_id": "gpt-4"
}
```

### Create Agent with Claude Code Runtime

```python
agent = {
    "name": "Code Reviewer",
    "runtime": "claude_code",  # New!
    "model_id": "claude-sonnet-4",
    "configuration": {
        "runtime_config": {
            "permission_mode": "acceptEdits",
            "cwd": "/workspace/project"
        }
    }
}
```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Apply Database Migration

```bash
cd /Users/shaked/projects/orchestrator/agent-control-plane

# Apply migration
psql $DATABASE_URL < db/migrations/010_add_runtime_to_agents.sql

# Verify
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT COUNT(*), runtime FROM agents GROUP BY runtime;"
```

### 2. Install Claude Code SDK

```bash
cd cli/internal/cli/worker_files

# Install SDK
pip install claude-agent-sdk

# Update requirements.txt
echo "claude-agent-sdk>=0.1.0" >> requirements.txt
```

### 3. Update Worker to Use New Executor

**Option A: Direct replacement (recommended)**

In `activities/agent_activities.py`:

```python
# Change line ~5:
from services.agent_executor import AgentExecutorService

# To:
from services.agent_executor_v2 import AgentExecutorServiceV2 as AgentExecutorService
```

**Option B: Gradual rollout**

Keep both and use feature flag to toggle.

### 4. Test Locally

```python
# Test with Python
cd cli/internal/cli/worker_files

# Run unit tests
pytest tests/unit/test_runtimes.py -v

# Test agent execution
python -c "
from runtimes import RuntimeFactory, RuntimeType
factory = RuntimeFactory()
print(factory.get_supported_runtimes())
# [RuntimeType.DEFAULT, RuntimeType.CLAUDE_CODE]
"
```

### 5. Deploy Worker

```bash
# Build new image
docker build -t agent-worker:v2-runtime .

# Deploy
kubectl apply -f deployments/worker.yaml

# Watch logs
kubectl logs -f deployment/agent-worker --tail=100
```

## Testing Different Runtimes

### Test Default Runtime (Agno)

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-api.com/api/v1/executions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agent_id": "existing-agent-id",
    "prompt": "Analyze this data: [1,2,3,4,5]",
    "runtime": "default"
  }'
```

### Test Claude Code Runtime

```bash
# 1. Create agent with Claude Code runtime
AGENT_ID=$(curl -X POST https://your-api.com/api/v1/agents \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Code Reviewer",
    "runtime": "claude_code",
    "model_id": "claude-sonnet-4"
  }' | jq -r '.id')

# 2. Execute with file operations
curl -X POST https://your-api.com/api/v1/executions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{
    \"agent_id\": \"$AGENT_ID\",
    \"prompt\": \"List all Python files in the current directory and count lines of code\"
  }"
```

## Architecture Benefits

(Agno)    (SDK)         (LangChain)
```

## Key Patterns Used

### 1. Strategy Pattern
Different runtimes implement same interface

### 2. Factory Pattern
`RuntimeFactory` creates appropriate runtime

### 3. Adapter Pattern
Each runtime adapts its framework to common interface

### 4. Protocol Pattern
Python Protocol for structural typing

## Runtime Comparison

| Feature | Default (Agno) | Claude Code |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Tool Calling | Via toolsets | Native tools |
| File Operations | Custom toolsets | Native |
| Code Editing | Via tools | Optimized |
| MCP Support | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Streaming | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Cancellation | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |

## When to Use Each Runtime

### Use Default (Agno) For:
- Existing agents (no migration needed)
- Custom toolset integrations
- General conversational agents
- Database operations
- API integrations

### Use Claude Code For:
- Software engineering tasks
- Code review and analysis
- File system operations
- Documentation generation
- Project scaffolding
- CI/CD automation

## Monitoring

### Check Agent Runtime Distribution

```sql
-- Count agents by runtime
SELECT runtime, COUNT(*) as count
FROM agents
WHERE status != 'archived'
GROUP BY runtime;

-- Recent executions by runtime
SELECT
    a.runtime,
    COUNT(e.id) as execution_count,
    AVG(e.duration_ms) as avg_duration_ms
FROM executions e
JOIN agents a ON e.entity_id = a.id
WHERE e.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY a.runtime;
```

### Track Runtime Performance

Add to your monitoring dashboard:

```python
# Metrics to track
- execution_count_by_runtime
- avg_latency_by_runtime
- error_rate_by_runtime
- token_usage_by_runtime
- tool_execution_count_by_runtime
```

## Rollback Plan

If needed, rollback is simple:

```bash
# 1. Revert worker deployment
kubectl rollout undo deployment/agent-worker

# 2. Optionally reset agent runtimes
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "UPDATE agents SET runtime = 'default' WHERE runtime = 'claude_code';"
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Required)
1. ✅ Review architecture design
2. ⏳ Apply database migration
3. ⏳ Install Claude Code SDK
4. ⏳ Deploy updated worker

### Short Term (This Week)
5. ⏳ Test with sample agents
6. ⏳ Update API models (add runtime field)
7. ⏳ Create monitoring dashboard

### Medium Term (This Month)
8. ⏳ Update UI with runtime selector
9. ⏳ Write user documentation
10. ⏳ Migrate high-value agents to optimal runtimes

### Long Term (Next Quarter)
11. ⏳ Add more runtimes (LangChain, etc.)
12. ⏳ Build runtime recommendation system
13. ⏳ Optimize runtime selection per use case

## Remaining Work

The core architecture is complete. Remaining tasks:

- [ ] Update TeamExecutorService for mixed runtime teams
- [ ] Update agent activities to pass runtime info
- [ ] Add runtime field to API responses
- [ ] Write unit tests
- [ ] Write integration tests

These can be done incrementally after deploying the core functionality.

## Questions?

### How do I test locally?
```bash
cd cli/internal/cli/worker_files
pytest tests/ -v
```

### How do I switch an existing agent's runtime?
```sql
UPDATE agents SET runtime = 'claude_code' WHERE id = 'agent-id';
```

### What if Claude Code SDK fails?
The system falls back gracefully. The agent will return an error, but won't crash.

### Can teams have mixed runtimes?
Yes! The TeamExecutorService (next todo) will support this. Each agent in a team can use a different runtime.

### How do I add a new runtime?
1. Create new adapter implementing `AgentRuntime` protocol
2. Add enum value to `RuntimeType`
3. Update `RuntimeFactory.create_runtime()`
4. Done!
